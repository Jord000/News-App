# News App (Front End Development)

Link - https://thenewsjw.netlify.app/

News App is a social-media-news esq example for a website. This uses React to interact with my own created API and displays various articles, comments and votes. Users can log-in (un-authenticated) and view a feed of articles, these can be sorted by various values and also changed to a specific topic. Users can click on a specific article to see more detail, showing the article image, voting buttons, comment buttons and the full list of comments. Comments by the specific user logged in can be deleted. Error messages will show for invalid interaction with buttons and also for bad requests or bad endpoints.
